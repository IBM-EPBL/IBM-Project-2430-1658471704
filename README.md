Detecting Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning
More than 10 million people are living with Parkinson’s Disease worldwide, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation. While Parkinson’s cannot be cured, early detection along with proper medication can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.

The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the pen pressure is lower among Parkinson’s patients. One of the indications of Parkinson’s is tremors and rigidity in the muscles, making it difficult to draw smooth spirals and waves. It is possible to detect Parkinson’s disease using the drawings alone instead of measuring the speed and pressure of the pen on paper. Our goal is to quantify the visual appearance(using HOG method) of these drawings and then train a machine learning model to classify them. In this project, We are using, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor along with a Random Forest classifier to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.

# Project Objectives
<h3> By the end of this project:</h3>
<ul >
<li>You’ll be able to understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.</li>

<li>You will be able to know how to pre-process the image by using different data pre-processing techniques.</li>

<li>you will be able to learn how to use OpenCV and machine learning to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.</li>

<li>You will be able to know how to find the accuracy of the model.</li>

<li>You will be able to build web applications using the Flask framework.</li>
</ul>

# Project Flow

<ol>
 <li> User interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input  </li>
 
 <li> The uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated </li>

 <li> Once the model analyzes the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI and OpenCV window </li>
</ol>

## To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below 

<ol>

 <li>Data Collection </li>

 <li> Collect the dataset or Create the dataset </li>

 <li>  Image Preprocessing. </li>

 <li> Importing the required libraries </li>

 <li> Loading Train data and Test data  </li>
 
 <li> Quantifying images </li>

 <li> Label Encoding </li>

 <li> Model Building </li>
 
 <li> Training the model </li>

 <li> Testing the model  </li>

 <li> Model Evaluation </li>

 <li> Saving the model </li>

 <li> Application Building </li>
